# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects.

Welcome! This repository contains all my coding projects from **The Tech Academy’s Basic C# course**. Each project in this repository reflects my learning and progress as I complete various assignments and challenges designed to build a strong foundation in C# programming.

## 📁 Repository Structure

As I progress through the course, I will add folders for each project and include source code, notes, and other relevant files.


## 🚀 Goal

The goal of this repository is to serve as both a personal learning resource and a professional portfolio to showcase my skills in C#. It will be consistently updated as I complete more projects throughout the course.
